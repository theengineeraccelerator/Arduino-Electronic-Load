	3 LED System
		Characteristics
			- Red,Yellow and Green LEDs
            - Green LED indicates normal operation of the loading as specified in the Arduino
            - Yellow LED indicates a range in which the source is closer to over loading (A range specified in the Arduino)
			- RED displaying over loading and hence source has been interrupted
	Computer
		Characteristics
			- Uses Arduino serial monitor for display
			- Displays current to be drawn, set by user

			- User interface for controlling using serial monitor 
            - Power ARDUINO using USB cable within the operating voltage range
	Arduino
        Characterstics
            - Delivers power to different circuit blocks as per their rating
            - Controlls the normal operation of the testing device and send signal to display using LED system
			- Receives temperature signal from TEMPERATURE SENSOR 
            - Sends Turn ON/OFF signal to the fun system based on temperature level
			- Receives sensed Current from CURRENT SENSOR and sends to COMPUTER
			- Receives sensed volatage from VOLTAGE SENSOR and sends to COMPUTER
            - Sends signal to OVERLOAD INTERUPTER to interupt testing operation during overloading
